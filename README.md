# Running an experiment
Note that this is designed to run on the Ohio Diabetes dataset. You need to
explicitly state the absolute file path to the XML file of the patient you want
to train the model for in the experiment configuration file (YAML file).

Except for that, everything should run out of the box.

    $> chmod +x run.py
    $> ./run --file experiments/example.yaml -m train
